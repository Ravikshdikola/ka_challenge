In this AI challenge, your goal is to classify math problems—written in natural language—into one of eight predefined topics (e.g., algebra, calculus, topology). You'll train a model that can accurately predict the topic based on the text of the problem.

Key Details:

Evaluation Metric: F1 Score (micro-averaged) using f1_score(y_true, y_pred, average="micro") from scikit-learn.

Allowed Models: Only open-source models may be used. Closed-source or paid models are strictly forbidden.
